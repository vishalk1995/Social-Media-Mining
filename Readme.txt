2. validation.py : use to predict the accuracy over the validation set.
3. test_prediction.py : use to generate the label of observation in test.csv
4. smm_project2_model.h5 : This is the model generated by project2.py and is used by both 			   validation.py and test_prediction.py.
5.submission.csv : the output generated by test_prediction.py.
6. KUMAR_MAJMUDAR_PJ2.pdf : our report.
